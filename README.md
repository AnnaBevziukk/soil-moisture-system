This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).
## 🌱 Soil Moisture Monitoring System
This project is an information system for monitoring soil moisture using IoT devices, server-side logic in Next.js, and integration with weather services. The system automatically records soil moisture, analyzes plant health, and provides irrigation recommendations.

## 📌 Key Features
Collection of soil moisture data from hardware sensors

Automatic saving of readings to a MongoDB database

REST API for interaction with the frontend

Daily data aggregation (min / max / avg)

Integration with the OpenWeatherMap API to consider air humidity and temperature

Visualization of measurement history and plant status

Irrigation recommendation system

## ⚙️ Technology Stack
Next.js — frontend + backend on API Routes

MongoDB — database

Mongoose — data modeling

Node.js + cron — automatic tasks

WeatherAPI — weather forecasting

React Hooks — managing state and UI logic


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
